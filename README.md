**Easily call your horse with a goat horn whenever you need it**

_The horse can be anywhere, it always works to teleport it to you, even in unloaded chunks_

There's currently a bug, where if the horse you want to call is too far away it will be invisible after the teleport 

--> to fix that you have to **rejoin the game**

## How it works

**1.** Tame a horse

**2.** Give the horse any name

**3.** Look at the horse and run `/trigger get_horn_to_call`

**4.** You will then get a horn that looks enchanted and has the name of the horse

**5.** Whenever you use the horn, it will teleport to you

## Config

**To change the horn to call the horse** _for each player indiviudally_

```
/trigger change_goat_horn set value
```
value = 0 = ponder_goat_horn --> default

value = 1 = sing_goat_horn

value = 2 = seek_goat_horn

value = 3 = feel_goat_horn

value = 4 = admire_goat_horn

value = 5 = call_goat_horn

value = 6 = yearn_goat_horn

value = 7 = dream_goat_horn
